This is a simple X86 Intel 16-bit Assembler program to create a box with different kinds of functionality (such as moving, changing colors, changing text
scroll speed, rezing, etc.) Need the DosBox emulator in order to run the program in real mode.


When you start DosBox, you need to mount a logical c drive for it to work on. Wherever you put the compiler, linker, and marquee.asm is where you need to
mount it.
For instance, if you mount it in your Program Files directory, type an instruction like this:

mount c C:\Program Files

And then type:

C:

After that, you'll be in the directory where everything is. After that, you can compile and link the program:

tasm marquee
tlink marquee
marquee
